In this project, we're working with a dataset of submissions to [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/) from 2006 to 2015. Hacker News is a site where users can submit articles from across the internet (usually about technology and startups), and others can "upvote" the articles, signifying that they like them. The more upvotes a submission gets, the more popular it was in the community. Popular articles get to the "front page" of Hacker News, where they're more likely to be seen by others.

We'll be writing scripts to answer some main questions:

* What words appear most often in the headlines?
* What domains were submitted most often to Hacker News?
* At what times are the most articles submitted?
